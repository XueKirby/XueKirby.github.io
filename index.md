##Sometimes we may not use LTE in the phone uses a new custom ROM. The problem comes from the baseband. Nearly all the functions like SMS MMS and phone calls depend on the baseband. Unlike the official ROM, custom ROMs do NOT provide a baseband. Sometimes it will go wrong. You should flash a proper firmware by flashing a proper official ROM. Then type in *#*#4636#*#* and enter Phone information menu. The last thing is to set preferred network type to WCDMA preferred. Then this issue will be figured out.
